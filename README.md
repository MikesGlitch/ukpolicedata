# ukpolicedata

Create a UI for this API: https://data.police.uk/   

# Ideas
- Are there any other sources of data I can use to link up with it?
- Can I show close to real time data?
- A crime rating by area: High, medium, low etc
- What times do most crimes occur?
- How many crimes happen and are reported every day?

# Who would use this?
- People looking to move house and want to check the crime stats for an area
- People interested to see what the police have to deal with

# Tech (cost is important just now)
- Vue UI on Azure Static web apps
- Azure Functions with .NET API
